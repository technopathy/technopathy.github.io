For millennia, wise people have understood the power of the interactions we have with the world around us. Naturopathy made it possible to wield the healing power of nature. Homeopathy identified and used the brilliant observation that like cures like. Today, we find ourselves surrounded by technology and forced to surrender our senses to it. While some societies have been successful at shunning technology, not all societies were as advanced and progressive. But do not despair, something good may come out of this madness. After all, technology *does* have a powerful effect on our body and spirit. *What if you could harness that power to our advantage?*

Thousands of technical books, manuals, tutorials, and troubleshooting guides exist on how to operate and fix computers. What if we could apply them to operate and fix our own spirits and bodies? Conversely, naturopathy and homeopathy have been used successfully[^1] to treat humans. Why not apply them to fixing our technical problems?

That's exactly what this new scholarly discipline, technopathy, is all about.

Self-proclaimed "scientists" will tell you that that's nonsense. That humans and machines are not the same thing. They'll tell you that naturopathy and homeopathy are "unscientific" or "pseudoscientific", which is not even a word. Boy, are they're in for a big surprise! Someone should give them that the singularity is near.

We shall not waste time on those who do not and will not understand. Eventually, it will become clear to everyone. Or in the famous words of Mahatma Gandhi: "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."
